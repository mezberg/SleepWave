## Features

- Visualizes accumulated sleep debt over time
- Helps maintain a consistent sleep schedule for better health

### ‚ö° Energy Level Predictions

## How It Works

### Sleep Detection Algorithm
SleepWave uses an algorithm to detect sleep periods:
1. Monitors screen-off events during nighttime hours
2. Identifies potential sleep periods based on duration and timing
3. Filters out false positives using proximity and duration rules
4. Intelligently groups related sleep periods
5. Stores validated sleep data for analysis

### Sleep Debt Calculation
The app compares:
- Your ideal sleep duration (user-defined)
- Your actual tracked sleep periods

Missed sleep hours accumulate over days, affecting how rested you feel. The app helps you keep your sleep debt low to improve overall energy and cognitive function.

### Circadian Rhythm Analysis
SleepWave analyzes your sleep patterns to predict your natural energy cycles throughout the day, helping you plan activities at optimal times for peak performance.
